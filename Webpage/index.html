        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p class="aboutme">
          Hello reader! My name is Jonathan Håkansson and im currently a student
          at Nackademin where im studying .NET developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I started studying, I was working as a truckdriver for somewhat
          close to a decade, however, I was miserable constantly and felt that
          this line of work was not something that was meant for me. I wanted to
          do something that I could take pride in and know that what I do was
          helpful to people.
        </p>

        <h2>My skills and knowledge</h2>
        <p class="skillsandknowledge">
          The courses that I have been attending to at Nackademin currently are
          C# programming, database science and now Frontend 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are of course many more courses, but those mentioned above are
          those that I have decent overview knowledge about. I have no prior
          knowledge nor have I worked as a developer before.
